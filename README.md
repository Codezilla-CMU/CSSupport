## Deployment

To deploy this project

```
# Set-Up Apps Script

**Step 1:** Open the Apps Script in Google Workspace and add `Status`, `Repair`, and `Regfixer` to the Apps Script. These files establish connections between Line and MongoDB.

- `Status` is used to display the status of users and fixers.
- `Repair` is used for user repair requests.
- `Regfixer` is used for registering or adding repair technicians.

**Step 2:** Add Files - `status.html`, `regfixer.html`, `repair.html`

These files serve to retrieve user information from Line LIFE:

- `status.html` is used to link to the Status page on Line.
- `regfixer.html` is used to link to the Repair page on Line.
- `repair.html` is used to link to the Regfixer page on Line.
